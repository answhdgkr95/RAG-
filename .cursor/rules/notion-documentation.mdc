## TITLE FORMAT

`{Module}_{Description} [{ScreenID}]`

## BLOCK USAGE STRATEGY

- **Page Title**: `heading_1` (Implicitly used for the page title)
- **Main Sections**: Use `heading_2` for `🎯 CURSOR COMMAND`, `🔧 WORK PERFORMED`, `➡️ NEXT COMMAND`.
- **Sub-Sections**: Use `heading_3` for detailed points like "File Modified" or "Code Changes".
- **Lists**: Use `bulleted_list_item` for itemized details under each section.
- **Code**: Use `code` blocks for before/after snippets.
- **Spacing**: Use empty `paragraph` blocks for visual separation.

## CONTENT GUIDELINES

- **Language**: English for rules, Korean for content
- **Structure**: Use emojis + specified block types for clarity.
- **Code**: Include before/after snippets in code blocks.
- **Results**: Document outcomes clearly.

## NOTION API SEQUENCE

1. Create page under specified parent.
2. Add title with format.
3. Insert structured content using the block strategy.

## EFFICIENCY RULES

- Keep content concise but complete.
